How to archive game files / assets

# So you're finally done with your Ren'py game and are looking at the Build Distribution screen. 
# In order to lock / hide game files once you distribute the game, you have to follow these steps.

1. Go into options.rpy
2. Find this string on options

## To archive files, classify them as 'archive'.
    # build.classify('game/**.png', 'archive')
    # build.classify('game/**.jpg', 'archive')

# Before we edit under, we must understand what 'build.archive' & 'build.classify' does

# 'build.archive' = makes a file for all game assets named to be compressed into.
# 'build.classify' = puts the game assets into the archive file
