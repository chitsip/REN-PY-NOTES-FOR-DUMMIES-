# Placing your Ren'Py game icons!
____________________________________________________________________________________________________

FIRST You are going to need TWO versions of your icon
# Before we get started, you need to know why we need TWO icons!

'icon.ico' = shows the icon during the game
'window_icon.png' = shows the icon in the taskbar

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

# Now, here's what we need

1. a png icon (256x256)
2. a duplicated png icon that you must convert using a website to '.png' to '.ico'

# Make sure that BOTH of your icon dimensions are 256x256
# Make sure that you named the '.ico' icon to 'icon.ico'
# For example if your icon was named 'poop' rename it to 'icon.ico'

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

# Time to place the icons !

  1. Put 'icon.ico' into BASE folder. (Just drop it in there, it's fine lol)
  2. Rename your png icon to 'window_icon.png' in gui folder (you're replacing the default Ren'py icon!)
