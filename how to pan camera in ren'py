# Panning your camera in Ren'py !
# For some reason, this isn't shown in Ren'py docs but is by far the best method I've seen

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

# This is an example and I will explain to you what each part does, so don't fret.

show image with fade:
    zoom 2 align (0.1, 0.4) subpixel True
    easein 2.5 align (0.1, 0.2)

# 'zoom 2' zooms in to the image shown

# 'align (0.1, 0.4)' = tells the camera where to START using the x and y axis

# 'subpixel True' = subpixel is a transform property, so you must include this for it to be an panning animation

# 'easein 2.5' = is another transform, that eases into the camera coordinates

# 'align (0.1, 0.2)' = tells the camera where to STOP using the x and y axis

If error rolls:
Check if you have the colon ':' after showing the image
Check the indentations






















show image with fade:
    zoom 2 align (0.1, 0.4) subpixel True
    easein 2.5 align (0.1, 0.2)
# image pan
# align = image placement
# first align string = first placement, second string = ending placement
# subpixel is a Transform Properties of ATL, so it must be set for each animation
